The insulation of TADs in GM12878 cells was calculated by averaging the two insulation scores of their boundaries, as calculated by Gong and co-workers (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29416042/). 
Then, TADs were grouped into five groups of similar size based on their TAD insulation scores, from low to high insulation. 
The original TAD boundary insulation scores were kindly provided by Aristotelis Tsirigos and are provided here with his permission.
