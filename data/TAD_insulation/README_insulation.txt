The insulation of TADs in GM12878 cells was calculated by averaging the two insulation scores of their boundaries, as calculated by Gong and co-workers (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29416042/). 
Then, TADs were grouped into five groups of similar size based on their TAD insulation scores, from low to high insulation. 
The original TAD boundary insulation scores were kindly provided by Aristotelis Tsirigos and are provided here as a compressed file with his permission.
For each sample they used in the paper, there is a separate folder. Within each folder you will see 5 separate bed files corresponding the 5 boundary strength categories they defined in the original paper (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29416042/). Any question about the original data should be addressed to:
